The Atlanta Synthesizer Club is a community of people with a shared interest
in synthesizers of all types. Members range from people just starting to explore
the world of synthesis to big name industry veterans. We take pride in our
community showing off those famous Southern Manners and keeping the traditional
Internet vitriol at bay.

If you live in Atlanta, or the south east in general, and are looking for a
community where you can ask any question about synthesis, or look for a fair
trade on gear, find us on [Facebook][fbgroup] and [Discord][discord].
